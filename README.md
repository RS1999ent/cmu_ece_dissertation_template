cmu_ece_dissertation_template
=============================

A LaTeX template for PhD dissertations that conforms to the ECE
department's requirements.

This is a template for a CMU ECE dissertation.  It conforms to the
requirements from ECE as of May 2013.  Most importantly, the title
page is formatted as per ECE standards and does not contain the list
of committee members.  The copyright notice appears on the third page
(i.e., the second front-facing page).  This template was modified from
cmuthesis.cls, published by David Koes (www.cs.cmu.edu/~dkoes).  The
next comment block below is from the original cmuthesis.cls file.
